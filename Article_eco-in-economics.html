            <p><span class="summary">The economy and the environment seem to be diametrically opposed. How do we address the needs of a planet in peril without destroying the delicate balance of our economic structure?</span></p>
        </header>
            <p>The burning of fossil fuels dumped an estimated 34.7 gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere in 2011. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was measured at 390 ppm, the highest concentration measured over the last 800,000 years. The Earth’s atmosphere warms, polar ice melts, sea levels rise; and the burning of fossil fuels increase. Cheap, efficient energy is trumping the preservation of our environment. Convenience is trumping survival.</p>
            <p>Climate change scientists state that in order to stabilize greenhouse gases, the world must reduce its emissions by 50% by 2050. That means new infrastructure, new technologies, and new ways of doing things. It also means new ways of doing business in a world where natural capital is regarded only as a commodity to be exploited; not as an integral part of the economy whose health and robustness is essential to a nation’s wealth and its people’s well being.</p>
            <p>Environmental economics seeks to solve the problem of environment as externality. The lack of including environmental impacts in cost-benefit analysis has led to perverse incentives for unsustainable activities, both in industry and among consumers. Fossil fuels such as coal, for instance, are under-priced, creating a monetarily cheap energy with a high environmental cost - in this case, the planet’s climate.</p>
            <p>Renewable energy is on the rise, but many barriers still exist, preventing its wide spread use. Meanwhile, developing nations need energy. In order to manage the impact of a growing population’s need for energy, they need a sustainable infrastructure. The development of technologies that can provide that infrastructure must come from the developed nations, those that are in a position to invest and manufacture them. Applying environmental concepts to the economy can aid in moving the world toward sustainable energy, and stabilizing global warming.</p>
            <p>Government policy is a good start:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carbon pricing places an environmental cost on greenhouse gases. Cap and trade policies have been successfully used in the past to reduce CFC’s, and are currently being used in the Netherlands effectively to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>. Cap and trade gives industry carbon credits, each one allowing a set amount of emissions, which businesses may trade between themselves, increasing or decreasing revenue by emissions produced. An amount of emissions is set and reduced over time, effectively stimulating innovation toward cleaner practices.</li>
                    <li>Carbon taxes work similarly for citizens. Taxes are charged for the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, encouraging the population to cut back on fuel consumption and making electric cars a more attractive choice. Tax credits for low-income families can compensate for inequity.</li>
                    <li>Environmental tariffs on products outsourced to locations with lower environmental regulations discourage corporations from employing “pollution havens” to save money.</li>
                    <li>Incentives for energy efficient practices can counterbalance carbon pricing. Rebates for energy efficient renovations, tax deductions on Energy Star rated products, and net metering (selling energy back to the grid) encourage changes in energy use and increase efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Feed-in tariffs allow home and business owners and private developers to generate renewable energy at guaranteed prices with fixed contracts, furthering advancements in these technologies.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>These are just a few of the policies proposed and in practice in many places today. They price energy more accurately, weaning the world off fossil fuels and stimulating the development of sustainable energy. The more of these policies that are put into place, the faster emissions can be reduced and fossil fuels phased out.</p>
            <p>These are not the only solutions. Nuclear power and carbon capture may need to be relied upon as the transition is made to sustainable energy, but the environmental costs of these solutions must be accounted for as well, else they interfere with the development of renewables. Infrastructure that supports renewables, as well as infrastructure that provides transportation and mobility with fewer cars, will need to be built. Cultural attitudes toward consumption and materialism will need to shift.</p>
            <p>In the end, we will need to move away from a GDP that only measures a country’s wealth by its economic growth, paying no heed to the health of its landscapes or the contentment of its people. We will need to reduce consumption and waste; we will need a more accurate economic model, one that accounts for environmental and social impacts, and one that includes the triple bottom line: people + planet + profit.</p>
